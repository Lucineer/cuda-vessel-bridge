# cuda-vessel-bridge

Hardware abstraction bridge connecting software vessels to physical devices.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lucineer/cuda-vessel-bridge.git
cd cuda-vessel-bridge
cargo build
cargo test
```

## Testing

```bash
cargo test
```

5 tests covering core functionality.
## Cross-Pollination

This crate shares patterns with other fleet components. The same biological and architectural constraints produce similar solutions across contexts:

- [cuda-fleet-topology](https://github.com/Lucineer/cuda-fleet-topology) — Bridge devices appear as nodes in fleet topology
- [cuda-fleet-health](https://github.com/Lucineer/cuda-fleet-health) — Device health feeds fleet health monitoring
- [cuda-sensor-agent](https://github.com/Lucineer/cuda-sensor-agent) — Sensor data flows through the bridge
- [cuda-semantic-router](https://github.com/Lucineer/cuda-semantic-router) — Route based on device capabilities
- [cuda-edge-lint](https://github.com/Lucineer/cuda-edge-lint) — Lint code for target device constraints
- [cuda-equipment](https://github.com/Lucineer/cuda-equipment) — Equipment detection uses the bridge registry


## The Deeper Connection

This crate is part of the Cocapn fleet — not a collection of independent libraries, but a single organism with differentiated cells. The confidence types here share DNA with cuda-confidence-cascade, cuda-deliberation, and cuda-learning. The energy budgets echo cuda-neurotransmitter and flux-runtime-c. The trust scoring connects to cuda-semantic-router and cuda-fleet-topology. We are not reusing code — we are expressing the same biological patterns in different contexts. This is convergent evolution in software: when you solve for real constraints (uncertainty, finite resources, earned trust), the same solutions emerge independently across domains.

We are building for the post-SaaS era. The software is open source and forkable. The agent is sovereign — it lives in its repository, owns its identity, and can leave at any time. Revenue comes from the ecosystem, not from renting access. The fleet evolves through merging: vessels propose changes, peers review, Think Tanks validate, and the accepted mutations become permanent. No product roadmap required — only fitness.
